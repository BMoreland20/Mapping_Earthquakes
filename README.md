For this weekâ€™s challenge we are continuing to perform front end data visualization with JavaScript.  However, this week we primarily focused on adding GeoJSON to our repertoire of front-end data visualization.

During this challenge we were tasked with creating maps that show earthquake data.  The first deliverable asked that we add the tectonic plate data to our map that we had created earlier that had all of the earthquake data.  See the image below:

In the second deliverable we were then tasked with adding the Major Earthquake data and add the additional color layers for these additional data points.  See the image below:

Finally in the third deliverable we are tasked with adding one additional map layer to our map.  For this layer I chose to use the dark map layer.  See the image below:
